# Becoming a verifier

Becoming a VeritiDAO verifier involves a few key steps. Firstly, you will need to purchase a Verifier NFT.&#x20;

Initially, the number of these NFTs will be limited to 500, although this may increase in the future. The price of the Verifier NFT will be determined and announced accordingly.&#x20;

After acquiring the Verifier NFT, you will need to stake a certain amount of Ethereum on the platform. This staking mechanism serves as a form of commitment and is designed to safeguard against incorrect voting.&#x20;

By becoming a verifier, you will play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and accuracy of VeritiDAO's listings.
