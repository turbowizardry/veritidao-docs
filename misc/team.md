# Team

[Turbowizard](https://twitter.com/turbowizardry) built VeritiDAO, developing the front-end application and smart contracts. The entity manages all aspects of the project, ensuring its growth and smooth operation.&#x20;

Currently, Turbowizard is looking to expand the team with roles for front-end developers, smart contract engineers, and community managers. If you're interested in building the future with VeritiDAO, we'd love to hear from you. Please reach out to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VeritiDAO) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bMF4uC9rt2) to discuss potential opportunities.
