# Listing fees

VeritiDAO charges a fee of 3 ETH for new listings and 1 ETH for updates to existing listings. These fees are distributed as follows: 80% goes to the community of verifiers who validate the listings, and 20% is allocated to the VeritiDAO protocol for its upkeep and development.

<table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th width="139">Price</th><th>Verifier Revenue</th><th>Protocol revenue</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>New listing</strong></td><td>3 ETH</td><td>2.4 ETH (80%)</td><td>0.6 ETH (20%)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Update listing</strong></td><td>1 ETH</td><td>0.8 ETH (80%)</td><td>0.2 ETH (20%)</td></tr></tbody></table>

Becoming a verified entity with VeritiDAO offers several advantages. Verification boosts the visibility and trustworthiness of smart contracts, encouraging adoption by users and platforms. It also underscores the credibility of your project in the blockchain community. These benefits make the listing fees a valuable investment for projects seeking wider recognition and integration.
