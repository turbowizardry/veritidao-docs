# Create your listing

Listing your smart contract on VeritiDAO is a straightforward process. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you through it.

1.  **Copy Your Smart Contract Address and Pay the Listing Fee**

    Start by copying your smart contract address. Next, you'll need to submit the transaction and pay the listing fee. This process is handled directly through the VeritiDAO front-end.Please note that there might be a slight delay in the processing time as the transaction also needs to be processed by ZKSync.\

2.  **Add Relevant Metadata**

    After your transaction has been executed, you can add all the relevant metadata for your contract. This includes the contract's name, description, social media accounts, links to audits, or any other relevant information. The more data you provide, the better. This information will be beneficial for the voting community and any platforms consuming the data.\

3.  **Lock Metadata and Send for Voting**

    You can edit your metadata as many times as you like before you decide to lock it. Once you lock the metadata, your listing will be sent off for voting. Please note that you can only cancel your listing and receive a full refund of the listing fee before you lock the metadata.\

4.  **Mint Your Listing NFT**

    Once your contract has completed the voting process, you can mint your listing NFT. This process involves two transactions - one on ZKSync and one on the Ethereum mainnet. Depending on ZKSync's block syncing progress, this process might take some time.\

5.  **Success!**

    After your NFT is minted, anyone connected to VeritiDAO's listing contract will be able to receive your data and blue checkmark!\
