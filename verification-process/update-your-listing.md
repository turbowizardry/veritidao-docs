# Update your listing

Submitting an update to your listing on VeritiDAO is a straightforward process, similar to creating a new listing.

To begin, you must be the owner of the verified NFT linked to the listing you wish to update. Once you're ready to proceed, submit the update transaction and pay the update listing fee. After the payment transaction is initiated, your update follows the same path as a new listing.&#x20;

It goes through the same verification and voting process within the VeritiDAO community, ensuring the updated information maintains the integrity and accuracy that VeritiDAO listings are known for.
